Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a fully responsive e-commerce website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React. The website is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with key features such as a homepage, product listings, blog, cart, and customer support. It also includes essential sections like a user-friendly footer with categories, customer care, and social media integration.

This project aims to offer a modern and responsive design, providing users with an easy navigation experience and a visually appealing interface on both mobile and desktop devices.

Key Components Implemented
Responsive Design: The entire website layout is responsive, adjusting seamlessly across different screen sizes. Tailwind CSS classes are used to ensure that all components, including the header, footer, product listings, and blog sections, are mobile-friendly and look great on larger screens as well.

Homepage:

Hero Section: Featuring a large hero image or banner with a call-to-action.
Product Categories: A section for categorizing the products, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
Latest Blogs: Displaying the latest blog posts to engage users with content related to the products.
Footer: A well-designed footer containing contact information, categories, customer care links, social media icons, and a sign-up form.
